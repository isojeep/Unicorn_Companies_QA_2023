QA - Unicorn Companies Assignment 2023

The unicorn assignment was a very challenging assignment as it was my first python assignment and was very different from the basics we had learned in our tutorial class but I have managed to at the least produce answers to the questions within the recommended analysises in the assignment.

The file consists of 9 illustrations and data cleaning and title headers for each.
The most challenging aspect was converting some of the values from object to integers and or strings depending on how I wanted to manipulate the data.

The values in Valuation and Funding were initially objects with string values making it hard to manipulate the data accordingly to what was requested in the assignment so I converted them to integers removing all symbols and string characters to achieve my desired result.
